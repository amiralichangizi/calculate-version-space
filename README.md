Problem Solving:
1. Upload an Excel file to Google Drive <br />
2. Access to connect colab to Google Drive <br />
3. Get the file and put it in the table with the help of pandas library <br />
4. For ease of algorithm process, map positive and negative class to 1 0. <br />
5. Convert the table into two arrays and labels <br />
6. To be able to evaluate processing, we need our training and testing Detach from dataset. We do this using the Kfold algorithm with a division value of 10. <br />
7. Then, with the help of classical candidate elimination algorithm, we fit a model and the results We continue to calculate.
